# LinkedIn Network Analysis
 Analysis of LinkedIn connections using Python.
 
One of the main features of LinkedIn is professional networking. But if your network has grown to > 1K connections finding particular positions or specific companies can become an ordeal. For instance if you’ve started building your network several years ago and you have maybe lost track of old contacts. Sometimes, the standard free network analysis tools offered just don’t have what it takes to get the job done. Luckily Python comes to the rescue to take your insights to the next level!
